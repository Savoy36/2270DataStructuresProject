# 2270DataStructuresProject
Project for course 2270 Data Structures at CU Boulder by Savoy Smith 

###### Project Summary
Using Graphs and linked lists, store data about every NBA player including various stats and information about their game performance. Users can lookup a player, look at obscure stat rankings, etc. A value rating is automatically calculated for each player based on various stats and their annual salary. Players are organized and printed in this order based on their "value rating" unless stated otherwise. Adjacent vertices of graphs are teamates of a given player. When the printRoster() method is called as the user selects to print a team's roster, teamates are thrown into a linked list organized by value rating. 

###### How To Run
Clone the FinalProject.zip file and then extract those files to a folder on your pc. Open a terminal and compile with           -std=c++11 the two files driver.cpp and header.cpp. Run the program after it is compiled.  

###### System Requirements 
Tested using linux, but windows or Mac should also work.
