# 2270DataStructuresProject
Project for course 2270 Data Structures at CU Boulder


Create various data structures that can look up words stored in various data structures and give their definitions. It will time how long traversing each data structure takes. This is an attempt to learn about the various data structures we have learned and find out which data structures are most efficient for this sort of "look up word" format.
